The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. It uses the BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find augmenting paths and iteratively increases the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found.

Key Concepts:
Flow Network: A directed graph where each edge has a capacity (maximum flow that can pass through it), and there are source and sink nodes.

Maximum Flow: The largest amount of flow that can be sent from the source node to the sink node while respecting the capacity constraints on the edges.

Residual Graph: A graph that shows how much additional flow can be pushed through each edge. It is updated after every augmenting path.

Steps of the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm:
Initialization: Start with a flow of 0 for all edges in the network.

Find Augmenting Path: Use BFS to find an augmenting path from the source to the sink. This is a path where the residual capacity is greater than 0 for all edges in the path.

Update Residual Graph: Once an augmenting path is found, calculate the minimum residual capacity along the path, and adjust the residual graph by decreasing the capacities along the forward edges and increasing them along the reverse edges.

Repeat: Repeat the process until no more augmenting paths can be found, i.e., when BFS cannot find a path from source to sink.

Maximum Flow: The total flow is the sum of the flows through the edges that go from the source to the sink.

Explanation of the Code:
Graph Class:

The Graph class is used to represent the flow network, where graph is an adjacency matrix storing the capacities of edges.

The method add_edge adds a directed edge between two nodes with a specified capacity.

BFS Method:

The bfs method is used to find an augmenting path from the source to the sink. It updates the parent array, which stores the path from the source to the sink.

BFS is used here because it guarantees that the shortest augmenting path (in terms of the number of edges) is found, which is key to the correctness of the algorithm.

Edmonds-Karp Algorithm:

The edmonds_karp method performs the main algorithm. It repeatedly calls bfs to find augmenting paths and then adjusts the flow along these paths.

For each augmenting path, it calculates the minimum residual capacity and updates the flow and the residual graph accordingly.

The flow through the network is increased by the capacity of the found augmenting path until no more augmenting paths can be found.

Example Usage:

A graph is created with 6 vertices. We add edges along with their capacities.

The maximum flow from the source node (0) to the sink node (5) is calculated using the edmonds_karp method.

Example Output:
For the given graph, the output will be:

csharp
Copiar
The maximum possible flow is 23
Time Complexity:
The Edmonds-Karp algorithm has a time complexity of O(V * EÂ²), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because for each augmenting path found by BFS (which takes O(E) time), we may need to do this up to O(E) times (in the worst case where each augmenting path pushes only 1 unit of flow).

Conclusion:
The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is an efficient way to compute the maximum flow in a flow network, using BFS to find augmenting paths. Though its time complexity can be high for large graphs, it provides an intuitive and simple approach to solving the maximum flow problem.
