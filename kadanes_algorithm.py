##Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient method for solving the Maximum Subarray Problem, which involves finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array that has the largest sum. This algorithm operates in linear time, O(n), making it highly suitable for large datasets. 

##How Kadane's Algorithm Works:

## 1 - Initialization:
## 1.1 - Start by setting two variables:
## 1.1.1 - max_ending_here: Tracks the maximum sum of the subarray that ends at the current position. Initialize it to 0.
## 1.1.2 - max_so_far: Keeps record of the overall maximum sum found so far. Initialize it to a very small number (e.g., negative infinity).

##2 - Iteration:
## 1 - Traverse the array from left to right. For each element:
## 1.1 - Update max_ending_here by adding the current element.
## 1.2 - If max_ending_here becomes negative, reset it to 0. This step effectively discards any subarray with a negative sum, as starting fresh from the next element might yield a higher sum.
## 1.3 - Update max_so_far to be the maximum of its current value and max_ending_here.

##Result:
##After completing the iteration, max_so_far will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the array.

##Here's how you can implement Kadane's Algorithm in Python:

def kadane_algorithm(arr):
    max_ending_here = 0
    max_so_far = float('-inf')  # Initialize to negative infinity

    for num in arr:
        max_ending_here += num
        if max_ending_here < 0:
            max_ending_here = 0
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return max_so_far

# Example usage:
array = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]
result = kadane_algorithm(array)
print(f"The maximum subarray sum is: {result}")

##Output:
##The maximum subarray sum is: 7

##Explanation:
##In the example array [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], the contiguous subarray [4, -1, -2, 1, 5] has the largest sum, which is 7.

##Time and Space Complexity:
##Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The algorithm makes a single pass through the array.
##Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses only a constant amount of extra space.

##Applications of Kadane's Algorithm:
## 1 - Financial Analysis: Identifying the period with the maximum profit or loss in stock prices.
## 2 - Signal Processing: Finding the segment with the strongest signal in a noisy dataset.
## 3 - Image Processing: Detecting regions with the highest intensity in image data.
