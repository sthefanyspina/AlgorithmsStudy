#The Boyer–Moore Majority Vote Algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding the majority element in a list. The majority element is the one that appears more than half the time in the array. This algorithm is particularly efficient because it works in O(n) time complexity and uses O(1) space.

#Key Idea:
# 1 - Candidate Selection:
# 1.1 - The algorithm uses two variables: a candidate for the majority element and a count.
# 1.2 - Initially, the candidate is set to None, and the count is set to 0.
# 1.3 - As you iterate through the list, you update the candidate and count based on the following:
# 1.4 - If the count is 0, set the current element as the new candidate and set the count to 1.
# 1.5 - If the current element is the same as the candidate, increment the count.
# 1.6 - If the current element is different, decrement the count.
# 2 - Final Validation:
# 2.1 - After the first pass, the candidate is the potential majority element.
# 2.2 - A second pass is often necessary to verify that the candidate is indeed the majority element by counting its occurrences in the list and ensuring it appears more than half the time.

#Python Implementation

def boyer_moore_majority_vote(nums):
    # Step 1: Find the candidate using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
    candidate = None
    count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
            count = 1
        elif num == candidate:
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1
    
    # Step 2: Verify if the candidate is the majority element
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num == candidate:
            count += 1
    
    if count > len(nums) // 2:
        return candidate
    else:
        return None  # No majority element exists

# Example usage
nums = [3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]
result = boyer_moore_majority_vote(nums)
print(f"The majority element is: {result}")

#Explanation:
# 1 - Finding the Candidate:
# 1.1 - The algorithm first scans through the list to find a potential candidate for the majority element. If the count is zero, the current number is set as the new candidate.
# 1.2 - If the number matches the candidate, the count increases. If it doesn't, the count decreases.
# 2 - Validating the Candidate:
# 2.1 - After the first pass, the candidate may be the majority element, but we need to check how often it actually appears in the array. If it appears more than len(nums) // 2 times, it's the majority element. If not, return None (meaning no majority element exists).

#Time and Space Complexity:
#Time Complexity: O(n) because we go through the list twice — once to find the candidate and once to verify it.
#Space Complexity: O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space.

#Example:
#For the input:
nums = [3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]
#The majority element would be 4, because it appears 5 times (which is more than half of the list's length, which is 9).
#If the array does not have a majority element, the function would return None.
