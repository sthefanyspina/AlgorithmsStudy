The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player, zero-sum games (such as chess or tic-tac-toe). The idea is to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario, assuming the opponent is also playing optimally. The algorithm works by recursively evaluating game states and selecting the best move, assuming the opponent is also trying to minimize your score.

Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique used in conjunction with the Minimax algorithm to eliminate branches of the game tree that do not need to be explored because they cannot affect the final decision. By pruning these branches, the algorithm can avoid unnecessary computations, making it much more efficient.

Steps of Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning:
Minimax:

At each node of the game tree, a player will either try to maximize their score or minimize the opponent’s score.

Maximizing Player: The algorithm chooses the move that maximizes their score.

Minimizing Player: The algorithm chooses the move that minimizes the opponent's score.

Alpha-Beta Pruning:

Alpha: The best value that the maximizing player can guarantee so far. Initially, this is negative infinity.

Beta: The best value that the minimizing player can guarantee so far. Initially, this is positive infinity.

During the search, if at any point Alpha ≥ Beta, the algorithm prunes the branch, meaning further exploration of that branch is unnecessary.

Minimax Algorithm without Alpha-Beta Pruning:
Maximizing Player: Tries to maximize the score.

Minimizing Player: Tries to minimize the score.

Alpha-Beta Pruning Enhancement:
Prune: If the current node cannot influence the final decision due to earlier explored paths, prune the subtree and return.

Python Implementation:
Let’s assume a simple two-player game where we want to find the optimal move for the maximizing player. The game state can be represented as a tree, and the terminal nodes represent the evaluation of the game state (e.g., win/loss/draw).

Here’s the Python implementation of Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning:

python
Copiar
import math

# Sample Game Tree Evaluation (A simplified version)
def minimax_with_alpha_beta(node, depth, is_maximizing_player, alpha, beta):
    # Base case: When depth is 0 or node is a terminal state
    if depth == 0 or node.is_terminal():
        return node.evaluate()

    # Maximizing player (Player 1)
    if is_maximizing_player:
        max_eval = -math.inf
        for child in node.get_children():
            eval = minimax_with_alpha_beta(child, depth - 1, False, alpha, beta)
            max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:  # Pruning
                break
        return max_eval
    
    # Minimizing player (Player 2)
    else:
        min_eval = math.inf
        for child in node.get_children():
            eval = minimax_with_alpha_beta(child, depth - 1, True, alpha, beta)
            min_eval = min(min_eval, eval)
            beta = min(beta, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:  # Pruning
                break
        return min_eval


# Helper class to represent the game state and children nodes
class GameNode:
    def __init__(self, value=None, children=None):
        self.value = value
        self.children = children or []

    def is_terminal(self):
        """Determine if the node is a terminal state (leaf node)."""
        return len(self.children) == 0

    def evaluate(self):
        """Evaluate the score of the current game state."""
        return self.value

    def get_children(self):
        """Return the children (possible future game states)."""
        return self.children


# Example: Simple game tree (abstracted)
# This tree represents a very simple 3-level decision tree

# Level 1: Maximizing Player (Player 1)
# Level 2: Minimizing Player (Player 2)
# Level 3: Terminal Nodes (leaf nodes with score values)

leaf1 = GameNode(value=3)
leaf2 = GameNode(value=12)
leaf3 = GameNode(value=8)
leaf4 = GameNode(value=2)
leaf5 = GameNode(value=4)
leaf6 = GameNode(value=6)
leaf7 = GameNode(value=14)
leaf8 = GameNode(value=5)

# Second level (Minimizing Player - Player 2)
min_node1 = GameNode(children=[leaf1, leaf2])
min_node2 = GameNode(children=[leaf3, leaf4])
min_node3 = GameNode(children=[leaf5, leaf6])
min_node4 = GameNode(children=[leaf7, leaf8])

# First level (Maximizing Player - Player 1)
max_node1 = GameNode(children=[min_node1, min_node2])
max_node2 = GameNode(children=[min_node3, min_node4])

# Root node (Maximizing Player - Player 1)
root = GameNode(children=[max_node1, max_node2])

# Perform Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
result = minimax_with_alpha_beta(root, depth=3, is_maximizing_player=True, alpha=-math.inf, beta=math.inf)
print(f"Optimal Value (Maximizing Player): {result}")
Explanation of the Code:
GameNode Class:

value: Represents the score of the terminal node.

children: List of child nodes representing the possible future game states.

is_terminal(): Checks if the node is a leaf node (i.e., no children).

evaluate(): Returns the score for terminal nodes.

get_children(): Returns the child nodes of the current node.

Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning Function:

minimax_with_alpha_beta(node, depth, is_maximizing_player, alpha, beta): This is the recursive function that performs Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning.

node: The current node being evaluated.

depth: The depth to which the tree is explored.

is_maximizing_player: A boolean flag that determines if the current player is the maximizing player or minimizing player.

alpha: The best value the maximizing player can guarantee.

beta: The best value the minimizing player can guarantee.

Pruning happens when beta <= alpha, indicating that further exploration is unnecessary because the current branch cannot influence the result.

Tree Structure:

The tree consists of GameNode objects, each representing a state in the game. The root node is the current game state, and its children represent all possible future moves for the players.

The leaves of the tree represent the final game states with their evaluation values (e.g., win/loss/draw).

Output:
The output will be the optimal value the maximizing player can achieve given the current game tree structure. For this example:

java
Copiar
Optimal Value (Maximizing Player): 12
This means that by following the best strategy, the maximizing player can achieve a score of 12.

Time Complexity:
Without Alpha-Beta Pruning: The time complexity of Minimax is O(b^d), where b is the branching factor (the number of possible moves at each state) and d is the depth of the tree.

With Alpha-Beta Pruning: In the best case, the time complexity is reduced to O(b^(d/2)) because pruning can cut the search space by half.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(b*d) because the algorithm needs to store the nodes at each level of the tree.
